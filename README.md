# MyWrapper

The eventual concept of this application is to be a "MySpace" for ChatGPT. I don't like the ChatGPT
UI very much, and I know others have created better UIs. I want to allow users to customize the HTML
and CSS of this site in the same way MySpace does.

But it's more of a way for me to learn about the OpenAI API than a serious idea.

## Setup

1. Add your OPENAI_API_KEY to a .env file.
2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn start`.

Right now, all it does is make a single request to the OpenAI chat completion API.
